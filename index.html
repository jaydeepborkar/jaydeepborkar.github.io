	  <h3> Jaydeep Borkar </h3>
        <p><font style="verdana"><div class="a">
		Hi! I'm a third-year undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitribai_Phule_Pune_University" target="blank" >University of Pune.</a> My research and application areas fall in the field of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
		I love working at the intersection of Language, Computational Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to build systems through which humans and computers can talk to each other in ways that are natural, and not awkward, by overcoming all the adversaries. </p>
       <p>Living in India, where 22 different languages are spoken with 720 different dialects, I'm interested in building Natural Language Processing based solutions to various social problems, and I'm currently researching on that. 
        I'm exploring Natural Language Generation and how Reading Comprehension Models underperform after the introduction of adversarial perturbations. </p>
		<p>In my free time, I often listen to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garba_(dance)" target="blank">garbas</a> (I've won prizes as a garba player), write, read, volunteer, or I can be easily spotted on the streets of Pune trying out various cafes and restaurants.</p>
        Please have a look at <a href="#work">work</a> to know what and where I'm currently working at. You can also view my <a href="assets/resume/JaydeepB_ResumeFinal.pdf">CV</a>. If you want to discuss any interesting idea, share a funny meme or invite me over a cup of coffee, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> me.
